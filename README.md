- After specifying the address, press the "Make" button to show the specified hexadecimal or strings as a result.
- When you click "Save", those results will be saved in the table below.
- Press "Export Yara Rule" to finally create the yararule using variables stored in the privious step.
- The comment option on the upper right side annotates the assemblies nicely.
